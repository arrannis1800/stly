# STLY
It is a simple header-only library to implement different standard functions and helpful functions by my own

For now, I implemented:
- SmartArray that kind of `std::vector`
- Simple Matrix
- IntervalMap for working with intersected pairs of key-value
- And StopWatch for more comfortable working with time and check the speed of my code
